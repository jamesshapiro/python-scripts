# python-scripts

A collection of python scripts I have written that I use regularly.

The password scripts includes two offline utilities for generating secure passwords, one inspired by this website (http://passwordsgenerator.net/), another inspired by the XKCD method for creating memorable passwords.

The crypto directory includes a single script intended to report your profits (or losses) from investing in cryptocurrency without having to share your position or your gains/losses with any app or website.

The reminders directory includes a set of scripts that I use to send myself scheduled reminders over text and email.
